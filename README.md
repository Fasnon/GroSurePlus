GroSure+ is a continuation of my previous semesters’ CS project, GroSure. It is meant to help people to better plan their grocery trips, and manage their household finances. Families or groups of people living together, can use the app to better plan for their upcoming purchases, or better coordinate the buying of groceries to reduce time wastage or double purchases. 

Through this app, users can collaborate in the obtaining of materials and items for a common event, e.g. a Birthday Party, and help budget and manage everything, with what items to buy, when to go and buy, how much of each item to buy etc. 

Additionally, for members of the same household, if someone is already going on a trip, you can simply add an item to that trip, and the price and everything will be updated.

In this app, users can also specifically make trips for an occasion. Let’s say a user wants to bake a cake and has already made a trip buying all the items required. The user can then clone the trip, make any adjustments if needed, e.g. buy more ingredients if they want to make a bigger cake, and overall has a very easy time in managing this buying list.

These are just some of the many use-cases that this application has.
